    <div class="projecttitle"># ACADEMIA</div><br/>
    I'm currently a graduate student at Iowa State University's Ivy College of Business, pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems and Business Analytics, with a graduate minor in Philosophy. <a class="hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60162168-parth-shiralkar?shelf=currently-reading">I'm always on my Kindle</a>.
    <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. You can read a preliminary whitepaper my team and I wrote for one of our final projects <a href="http://www.ijarest.com/papers/finished_papers/150315113336.pdf" class="hover">here (PDF download)</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="projecttitle"># THE INDUSTRY</div>
    <br />
    In the summer of 2020, I interned with a delightful start-up in Ames, Iowa. As a part of a lean and agile product development cycle, working with <a class="hover" href="https://thehomepainter.com">homepainter</a> over the summer was an exciting experience. 
    <p>With over 7 years of development experience using a myriad of coding languages I am a seasoned I.T. specialist (Silicon Valley is one of my favorite shows of all time). My specialties lie in accurate and succinct documentation, clean and high quality code deployment, business process mapping and improvement, and statistical data analysis.
