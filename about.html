    # <b>ACADEMIA</b><br/>
    I'm a graduate student at Iowa State University's Ivy College of Business, pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems and Business Analytics, with a graduate minor in Philosophy. <a class="hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60162168-parth-shiralkar?shelf=currently-reading">I'm always on my Kindle</a>.

    # <b>THE INDUSTRY</b>
    <br />
    I'm currently interning with a delightful start-up in Ames, Iowa. As a part of a lean and agile product development cycle, working with <a class="hover" href="https://thehomepainter.com">homepainter</a> over the summer is an exciting experience.
