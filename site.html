<div class="bodytext">
The domain I use for my personal website has its registration renewed at the end of May every year. On its anniversary, I decided to rewrite the site from scratch.
<br/>
In addition to using plain HTML and CSS, I built this website using the following:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" class="hover">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" class="hover">Netlify</a>, a dynamic web-hosting platform</li>
</ul>
</div>
