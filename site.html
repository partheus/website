    <p class="underproj">this site is under active development as of today:
        <a href="https://github.com/partheus/website/projects/1">click on this sentence to view the live project.</a></p>
The domain I use for my personal website has its registration renewed at the end of May every year. On its anniversary, I decided to rewrite the site from scratch.
<br/><br />
There are several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161013192403/http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf" class="hover">Easter Eggs</a> being added to the site on a semi-regular basis. One can simply go through the source code to find them, but I believe that the satisfaction of stumbling across one at random far ooutweighs the satisfaction of a passionate egg-hunt.
<br /><br />
In addition to using plain HTML and CSS, I built this website using the following:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" class="hover">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" class="hover">Netlify</a>, a dynamic web-hosting platform</li>
</ul>
