    # <b>STUFF</b>
    <br />
    I love producing music. You can find some of my music on SoundCloud. Click <span></span><a class="hover" href="https://soundcloud.com/bhatji">here</a>.

    Sometimes I'll upload screengrabs of my production workflows on this site. One of them can be found <a class="hover" href="https://partheus.github.io/tripledutch">here</a>.
