    <div class="projecttitle"># ACADEMIA</div><br/>
    I'm currently a graduate student at Iowa State University's Ivy College of Business, finishing a Master's degree in Information Systems and Business Analytics, with a graduate minor in Philosophy. <a class="hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60162168-parth-shiralkar?shelf=currently-reading">I'm always on my Kindle</a>.
    <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. You can read a preliminary whitepaper my team and I wrote for one of our final projects <a href="http://www.ijarest.com/papers/finished_papers/150315113336.pdf" class="hover">here (PDF download)</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="projecttitle"># THE INDUSTRY</div>
    <br />
    I'll be graduating this May with a specialized STEM degree in Information Systems (UX and Business Analytics). If your team requires a creative product designer/web developer - please reach out! I love collaborating.
    <br />
    In the summer of 2020, I interned with a delightful start-up in Ames, Iowa. As a part of a lean and agile product development cycle, working with <a class="hover" href="https://thehomepainter.com">homepainter</a> over the summer was an exciting experience. 
    <p>With a technical background spanning over five years of development using a myriad of coding languages and on a variey of programming stacks, I am a seasoned I.T. specialist (Silicon Valley is one of my favorite shows of all time). My specialties lie in accurate and succinct documentation, clean and high quality code deployment, business process mapping and improvement, and statistical data analysis.

    <div class="projecttitle"># MORE OF WHAT I DO</div>
    <br />
    I'm a big proponent of greener lifestyles and waste-free living. I try out new plant-based recipes every week. I LOVE baby potatoes. My favorite dish is daal and rice, a common Indian recipe.
    <br />I'm also into wet shaving! I bought a custom wooden handle last year, and an assortment of safety double-edge razors. I enjoy the little ritual of setting aside 15-20 minutes for personal grooming very much.
