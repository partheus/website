      Hi! I'm Parth.
    <br/>
    <br />
    <div class="projecttitle"># ACADEMIA</div><br/>
    I'm currently a graduate student at Iowa State University's Ivy College of Business, pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems and Business Analytics, with a graduate minor in Philosophy. <a class="hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60162168-parth-shiralkar?shelf=currently-reading">I'm always on my Kindle</a>.
    <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. You can read a preliminary whitepaper my team and I wrote for one of our final projects <a href="http://www.ijarest.com/papers/finished_papers/150315113336.pdf" class="hover">here (PDF download)</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="projecttitle"># THE INDUSTRY</div>
    <br />
    In the summer of 2020, I interned with a delightful start-up in Ames, Iowa. As a part of a lean and agile product development cycle, working with <a class="hover" href="https://thehomepainter.com">homepainter</a> over the summer was an exciting experience.

    <div class="projecttitle"># THE ARTS</div>
   
    <br />- I love producing music. I also love listening to it, especially <a class="hover" href="https://synthspiria.com/en/everything-about-synthwave/">synthwave</a> and <a class="hover" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a47793/what-happened-to-vaporwave/">vaporwave.</a>
    <br/>
    <br />- You can find some of my music on SoundCloud; click <span></span><a class="hover" href="https://soundcloud.com/bhatji">here</a>.
    <br />
    <br />- Sometimes I'll upload screengrabs of my production workflows on this site. One of them can be found <a class="hover" href="https://partheus.github.io/tripledutch">here</a>.
    <br />
    <br />- I'm a self-published author on Amazon. My latest work is an e-collection of short stories, literally worth a bang for your buck [one (1) United States dollar]. Find <a class="hover" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rare-Objects-Strange-Places-Stories-ebook/dp/B08413JJ7P/">Rare Objects in Strange Places</a>.</li>
    <br />
    <br />- I write for the screen occasionally, and some friends and I have turned many a screenplay I wrote into a passable short film every now and then. Some day I'll publish them but for now enjoy <a class="hover" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huH-NMv1ad4">one of my favorite videos on the internet</a>.</li>
    <br />
    <br />- Video production and editing has been on my radar for a bit, so I'll be trying some of that out over the summer.
    <br /><br />
    
    <div class="projecttitle"># MORE OF WHAT I DO</div>
    <br />
    I try out new plant-based recipes every week; although I do not log them into an activity log, rest assured that they turn out great most of the time.
    <br/>
    My personal recommendation is that you get a nice supply of nutritional yeast flakes and use them like all-purpose seasoning.
