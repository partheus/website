The domain I use for my personal website has its registration renewed at the end of May every year. 
For its anniversary, I decided to rewrite the site from scratch.
<br/><br />
There are several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161013192403/http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf" class="hover">Easter Eggs (PDF download)</a> being added to the site on a semi-regular basis. 
One can simply go through the source code to find them, but I believe that the satisfaction of stumbling across one at random far outweighs the satisfaction of a passionate egg-hunt.
<p>[ TIP: on desktop screens, hover over things ]</p>

Although I'm an ardent fan of libraries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120418191647/http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm" class="hover">(see: Alexandria)</a>, there are no CSS libraries used on this site. 
<p>In addition to using plain HTML and CSS, I built (and continue to build) this website using the following:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" class="hover">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" class="hover">Netlify</a>, a dynamic web-hosting platform</li>
    <li><a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" class="hover">Liquid</a>, a templating language by Shopify</li>
    <li><a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/" class="hover">Nunjucks</a>, a templating engine for JavaScript by Mozilla</li>
</ul>

The usual suspects in my production environment are:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" class="hover">Node</a>, an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx" class="hover">npx</a>, an NPM package runner</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290" class="hover">Git</a>, a distributed version control system</li>
</ul>
These aren't the droids you were looking for.
