Perhaps the first thing anyone notices about the office is its slow, meandering identity, like a camel on its way home after a long day of chewing whatever it is they chew. Bob could see, at eye level, his own reflection in the slightly tilted mirror that Dana always hung on her far cubicle wall. But all of this means absolutely nothing without some exposition, without the semblance of a backstory at the very least.

Bob is our protagonist. In stark contrast to several of his professional peers (as a protagonist), Bob will never really grasp what it means to be the main character in a narrative; be it fictional or otherwise. It simply is better that way. Bob works at GERMCORE Technologies. He has worked there for as long as he can remember, and he shall work there for as long as he can imagine. It isn't a bad workplace, really. Bob loves it there, but for reasons unknown to both him and the reader.

GERMCORE Tech was founded on a half-lie, thus making it an ethically better corporation than three-fifths of the entire Fortune 500 list. The founder's name was something Bob could not clearly recall, much like the name of the people who had hired him, what, fifty? A hundred? Years ago. The problem with Bob, once again, was that he loved it there, but he had long forgotten what exactly "it" was.

And so we come back to the slow, meandering identity of this cage that Bob lived in. GERMCORE Tech produced and distributed the worst kind of midnight snack ever made: corrugated cardboard. The building (on a good day, it could be called a habitable structure) was shaped like a box; the most boring kind of box you could ever imagine. A humongous cuboid the color of a dull, dying cloud, the building was located at the heart of a metaphorical metropolis in the near future. There were other employees in the building, at least other than Dana, which Bob was sure of. He could hear sounds while he worked. Nothing coherent, just a stream of people mumbling to themselves. Like one of those coffee-shop filler talks you can play in the background to help you sleep. Bob never slept at work. In fact, he had no idea what it was like to sleep.

Bob was working on a "project" for GERMCORE. At least, that is what he thought it was called. The project was actually an inane experiment that had started out as a joke almost a quarter of a century ago. It was him. Bob had started the project. As a younger man far wiser than his age betrayed, Bob had put events into motion that would culminate into a social experiment; one that would consume him whole. But it was fine. It was all part of the plan.

Bob harbored a work ethic that could be classified under both "interesting" and "underwhelming" simultaneously. When Bob "worked" on something, he basically stared at whatever it was he was supposed to work on (like a file full of reports) till the file began to alter its appearance into something better, like a cake. Once that was done, Bob would simply eat it. Sometimes things would change into inedible horrid objects, like cucumbers. That was fine with Bob - inedibles went to the back, in storage.

Bob clocked into work at 8 am every single day, and clocked out at 8 pm (hopefully on the same day). This had been his routine for quite a while now, and he was too busy to think about changing it.

Anyway, he was staring at his reflection in Dana's mirror. Dana hadn't been to work for a week, maybe six. Maybe she was sick. Maybe she had done what he was always been afraid to do: alter her appearance into something more pleasant. Bob peered closely at the mirror. He noted the three breadcrumbs on the right half of his crumpled cream shirt; he could see his tan tie struggle to keep his neck up; his face was pasty and dry, like it had always been; what was left of his hair was arranged in a haphazard do, one that threatened to fall apart at even the mention of a sneeze; he stared into his bespectacled eyes, two tiny orbs devoid of emotion, and yet, alive with the dying embers of a burning passion. There were things at play he did not yet comprehend, but it was okay. For now, all he had to do was keep working. Like always.
